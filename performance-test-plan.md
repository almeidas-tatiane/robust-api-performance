# 🧪 Performance Test Plan

## 🎯 Goal
The objective of this test is to assess the system's behavior under expected load conditions.
It will evaluate the API’s performance across key functionalities, including authentication (/login) and CRUD operations for /items.

### 📦Test Endpoints
- ➕ POST /register - Create an user with username and password.
- 🔐 POST /login - Authenticate with username and password. Returns a JWT token.
- ➕ POST /items -  Creates a new item. Authentication: Requires JWT.
- 🔍 GET /items - Retrieves all items. Requires JWT.
- 🔍 GET /items/:id - Retrieves a specific item by ID. Requires JWT.
- ✏️ PUT /items/:id - Updates the item's name and/or description. Authentication: Requires JWT.
- 🗑️ DELETE /items/:id - Deletes an item by ID. Authentication: Requires JWT.

#### 🧪 Key Notes:
- The Load Generator (JMeter) will run in an EC2 at AWS.
- The Node.js API interacts directly with MongoDB Atlas using Mongoose.
- The application is secured with JWT tokens, required to access /items.
- Server-level monitoring is handled by Prometheus and Node Exporter, with Grafana dashboards for real-time performance metrics like CPU usage, memory, and request latency.

#### 🔧Technologies Used

- Node.js + Express  
- MongoDB Atlas (cloud-hosted database)  
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT)  
- bcryptjs (password hashing)  
- dotenv (environment config)  

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- The system must maintain an error rate below 1%.
- 90th percentile response time must be:
    - ≤ 200 ms for GET and DELETE requests
    - ≤ 500 ms for POST and PUT requests

- These thresholds apply under the following conditions:
    - 50 concurrent users
    - 10 requests per second

## 🛠️ Tools
- JMeter: (https://jmeter.apache.org/download_jmeter.cgi)
- Grafana: (https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/installation/)
- Prometheus: (https://prometheus.io/download/)

## ⚙️ Environment Pre-conditions

- ✅ **Application Deployment**: The API is deployed in a stable environment (e.g., staging or performance testing) with production-like configuration.
- ✅ **Database Initialization**: The database contains realistic and sufficient test data to simulate expected usage.
- ✅ **Monitoring Tools Available**: Tools such as Prometheus + Grafana, Node Exporter, or equivalents are configured and accessible.
- ✅ **JMeter Configuration**: JMeter (or another load testing tool) is installed and ready with preloaded test plans on the test machine (e.g., AWS EC2).
- ✅ **External Dependencies**: Any third-party services or APIs are either mocked or accessible and stable during testing.
- ✅ **Network Stability**: The connection between the load generator and the API is stable with minimal latency.
- ✅ **Time Synchronization**: All involved systems have synchronized clocks (e.g., via NTP) to ensure accurate time correlation.
- ✅ **Authentication Tokens**: JWT tokens (if required) are generated or retrieved automatically before testing secured endpoints.
